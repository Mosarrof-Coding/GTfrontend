          <p>
            Hi there, we’re Texam, and welcome to our privacy policy which also
            applies to our customers.
          </p>
          <p>
            This policy sets out how we handle your personal information if
            you’re an Texam user or visitor to our site.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we say ‘we’, ‘us’, or ‘Texam’, it’s because that’s who we are
            and we own and run the site.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we say ‘we’, ‘us’, or ‘Texam’, it’s because that’s who we are
            and we own and run the site.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we say ‘policy’ we’re talking about this privacy policy. If we
            say ‘user terms’ we’re talking about the rules for using the site.
            The rules vary by product; each product makes them separately
            available and seeks consent to them separately to this policy.
          </p>

            aren’t allowed to purchase any product or subscribe to the

            our service providers and files are kept in a secure location.
            Personal information that we store is protected by security and
            access controls, including username and password authentication,

            one of our email lists or have indicated that you are interested in
            receiving offers or information from us), we send you marketing
            communications by email about products and services that we feel may
            be of interest to you. You can ‘opt-out’ of such communications if
            you prefer not to receive them in the future by using the
            “unsubscribe” facility provided in the communication.
          </p>{" "}

          <h4>Cookies (Not The Type You Eat!) And Web Analytics</h4>{" "}
          <p>
            We use cookies to identify and track visitors, their actions on the

            We retain your personal information for as long as is necessary to
            provide the services to you and others and to comply with our legal
            obligations. If you no longer want us to use your personal
            information or to provide you with the Texam services, you can
            request that we erase your personal information and close your
            account.

          <h4>When We Need To Update This Policy</h4>{" "}
          <p>
            We will need to change this policy from time to time to ensure it
            stays up to date with the latest legal requirements and any changes
            to our privacy management practices. When changing the policy, we
            will notify you about such changes; where required, a copy of the
            latest version of this policy will always be available on this page.
