            Your buying information will be mailed to your email address. You
            have to create an account on our site to download any of our
            products. There are some reasons that your payment is not completed,
            and after that, we need to investigate and process the download info
            manually. So, delays can be as long as 1 hour to 48 hours based on
            the situation and extent of investigation required after a fraud
            alert has been activated.

            (including but not limited to copyright laws), as well as the laws

            violence, pornography, incivility content, or piracy links. We

            any improper usage. If you signed up on the Texam.com website, you

          <h4>Help/Support </h4>
          <p>
            Once you have downloaded our product, you may contact us for
            help/support via comment or by sending a message from the item

          <h4>Proprietary</h4>
          <p>
            You may not claim intellectual or monopolistic ownership of any of

          <h4>Anti- juggle</h4>
          <p>
            However, our customer purchases can be pending for a manual
            anti-cheat checkup to review the payment system. You will receive an
            elaborate email about your payment. An anti-cheat check happens due
            to the progressive number of deceptive transactions from individuals
            who are not genuine cardholders of the credit cards used during
            purchases. The customer account can be ceased for a manual
            anti-cheat check for 24 hours. Also, it can be ceased for a longer
            term for more investigations.
          </p>
